How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
I don't believe that there is a way  to be completely sure that something is functional and secure. Some steps that can be taken towards this are using a process for testing to discover errors, and working in a team to provide a variety of approaches. Keeping up with tech news is also a good idea to learn of newly discovered potential security flaws.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I think that having an open channel of communication with the user is vital for correctly interpreting their needs. If it is a large enough project, then creating a mockup or prototype of how I intend to incorporate them into a program would be an excellent choice to make sure we are both on the same page.

How do I approach designing software?
This is very much dependent on what the software is. If it is a personal project or something that is only expected to be used a couple times then I might just throw something together. If it's a large scale project or something that I think other people might work with, then I would be more careful and try to design it so that it could be extended or changed without too much hassle.
