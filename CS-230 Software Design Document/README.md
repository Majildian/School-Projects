- Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The client was a company that only had experience with providing a game for a single mobile platform. The software they requested a design for was a multi-platform web-based adaptation of that game.

- What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I think I did well in explaining the domain model.

- What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

For the development that I did, the only useful part of the document was the UML diagram. If the development had been more in depth, the process would have likely been more helpful.

- If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would pick the development requirements section. I would attempt to be more specific in what sets each platform apart from the others.

- How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

Although the stated software requirements helped in creating the design document, I also considered the experience of the client. For example, I suggested the server application be run on the Windows platform for ease of finding support staff, since the client was not experienced in setting up the environment. Since the software is being designed for the user, considering their needs when designing it will make it much more likely that the finished software will be an effective solution to their problem.

- How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I approached it "outside-in", or by considering what the biggest constraints the requirements would place on the software. By locking those in and proposing solutions for those first, it should cause fewer problems later in the design process. In the future I would like to take a more collaborative approach to designing a similar software application, as there were several occasions where I felt very unsure of my suggestions.
