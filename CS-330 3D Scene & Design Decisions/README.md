What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
I would say this project helped me improve my modular design skills, since the idea I had in mind was to make it easy to create each primitive shape and place it in the world where it was necessary.

What design process did you follow for your project work?
In this case, I had a concrete end goal (a 3D scene) in mind and an idea of what tools would be used (primitive shapes) to reach that goal. Since the tools were not simple to use, that was the main problem I wanted to solve by creating something that allowed me to place shapes by just adjusting a couple parameters.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
If I was to work on something like an API that allowed for complex tasks to be performed with only some input from a user, this experience would be helpful. Additionally, the ability to write modular or reusable code is very much in demand as that type of code is more efficient.

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
Something new that I used here was a post-build event to automatically copy various dependencies to the same directory as the executable. This ended up saving a decent amount of time while testing.

How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration was a large factor in my development, as I would often make a single change while working on the shape meshes (especially the cylinder and torus), then run the program to see if the change was effective. I also used it to adjust the location of the shapes as I was placing them to make the complex objects.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
I don't believe my overall approach to developing code has changed during this course. As for how I approached this project, the only change I can be sure of is that I initially attempted to implement the torus and cylinder meshes without referencing other code, but near the end I decided to reference other code to save time.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
Some practical experience working with matrices is likely to be useful in further classes. Being able to break something down to its basic components like I did with the original 3D scene is also very likely to be useful.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
Although not strictly related to graphics and visualizations, I had quite a bit of practice adapting other code to my purposes in this course, and I imagine that skill will be very useful in a professional setting. Many products have a visual aspect as well, so having some experience with creating visuals could broaden my options.
