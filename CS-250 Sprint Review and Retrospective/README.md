How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

I think a good approach is to focus on what the user is trying to accomplish, rather than exactly what they ask for. Doing so may allow for discovery of more effective ways of accomplishing that goal, though checking with the user is still necessary to confirm the effictiveness. User stories help to consolidate the feature request, its purpose, and what it should accomplish to be considered "done" all in one place, increasing efficiency.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

My first step is to make sure I understand what the program should do, then I spend some time thinking about how to implement the program. When I think I have a good idea of how to do so, I start coding and testing. If it is a complex program, then I try to focus on one feature at a time and make sure it works well before moving on. Many of the agile processes seem to be focused on teamwork, but there are a couple of concepts that I would like to work on incorporating. First is the concept of "timeboxing", since it would give me a goal to complete a certain amount of features within a set amount of time and likely improve my productivity. The second concept is "user stories". I often have trouble with the scope of features and when they can be considered complete. I think having an outline of the feature, its purpose, and when it is complete would help me in developing well-rounded programs.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

I believe a good team member is one who prioritizes communication. Strong teamwork will increase the quality of the final product, and good communication is a significant factor in building that teamwork. One example is that a team member could make sure that both they and their team understand the requirements of a feature by asking questions of the product owner and clients. Another example is that the team member ensures that any code changes they make are well documented, so other team members can understand it if necessary.
