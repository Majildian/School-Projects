Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The client was a new business that was looking to fill a void by providing training for driving tests at their local DMV. They were looking for a web-based system that runs from the cloud, handles in-person driving lesson reservations, provides online classes, and stores some data about each in-person lesson taken.

What did you do particularly well?

One thing I believe I did well is define functional and non-functional requirements in enough detail to satisfy the business needs of the client.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

In an interview, the client provided a mockup of how they wanted one part of the interface to look. I think including that in the business requirements document would have been an improvement. I think I could have also gone into more detail in the technical requirements section of the system design document.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I first considered the client's descriptions of what they wanted the system to do, then tried to condense the descriptions into action statements and remove any redundancies. After that, I determined functional and non-functional requirements based on fulfilling or supporting these action statements. Since the user will be the ultimate judge of the system and its efficacy, designing towards fulfilling the needs of that user greatly increases the chances that a system will be successful.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I believe the most important steps in designing software are understanding the purpose of the final product, and understanding the targeted userbase. Doing so will make it much easier to create a focused system that has all the necessary features and is simple to use. One strategy that I think would be useful in the future is much higher interaction with the client and/or users of the system, in order to take a more iterative approach.
