Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

The client was a financial consulting company that developed plans for savings, retirement, investments and insurance. They requested an examination of their RESTful web API for security vulnerabilities and an adjustment to their application to allow them to securely transfer data.

What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?

I believe my explanation of the mitigation plan for their vulnerabilities was well done. Coding securely in the first place is far more efficient than having to go back to implement security features after vulnerabilities are discovered. Security features are vital for widely-used software, especially software that handles sensitive data such as personal information or financial data. Poor software security can lead to data leaks, lack of service coverage, or malicious system usage. Consequently, these can lead to a company losing the trust of their userbase, or facing severe fines - both of which can be disastrous for business.

What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?

The most challenging part of the vulnerability assessment was researching the reported vulnerabilities in the static testing reports to determine which of them applied to the codebase.

How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?

In the assessment report, my approach was to update the open source libraries used, then implement more secure coding practices in the codebase. When adjusting the application, I adjusted it to use the HTTPS protocol and provide a checksum hash for file verification. Static testing and manual review seem like strong techniques for assessing vulnerabilities, while online research is likely one of the best strategies for determining mitigation techniques.

How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

Since the codebase I was working with was small, I utilized manual testing to ensure that it was functional. For ensuring security, I used the knowledge from the previous vulnerability assessment as well as making sure that there were no vulnerabilities I had not previously examined. After refactoring, I performed another pass with the static testing tool and a manual review of the code.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?

I think the experience with the OWASP static testing tool and Maven will be helpful in the future. Additionally, the experience of working with a REST API is likely to be helpful as well.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?

The manual review section and mitigation plan section seem like solid candidates for showcasing, as they would both provide a look into my thought process for finding a solution.
